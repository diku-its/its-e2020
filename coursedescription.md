# Course Description

This course is a general introduction to IT-security.

Make sure that you read all the following carefully.

## Expectation and preparation for ITS
A significant part of the course is build on material from CompSys. If you feel the this material is a bit far away it is recommended to shortly recap this over the summer. The course book (SB) does include short background on some (but not all) parts, however if want to have the full understanding you need to consult the material from CompSys. I have tried to make a list of relevant topics.

* Computer Networks: the OSI model, application protocols, TCP/IP, DNS, firewall, routing, LAN, etc. This is not recapped in SB; read [Computer Networks, a top-down approach].
* Basic of cryptography. Recapped in SB chapter 2; will be covered in one of the exercises. Also covered in [Computer Networks, a top-down approach].
* Call stack, assembly code, virtual memory, etc. Will be shortly recapped in SB.

<!-- ### Programming
In the course we will not implement large programs; it is not the style of the topic. We will, however, read and understand code from different languages; e.g. C, Perl, SQL, and PHP. Even though you have not programmed is some of these languages, your current understanding of programming should be enough to read simple programs. But it is always a good idea to practice your programming skills.

### Shell scrips and terminal
You will work in the terminal and make simple shell scripts. We will have exercises

Exercises will be held weekly and will include help getting started on the assignment, feedback on the assignments. At some there will also be a recap of material relating to CompSys.

The exercises will be partly online and partly held at KU. Each week there will be room for half the students, so you are only guaranteed to be there every second week.

## Assignment

There are 6 weekly assignment during the course.

|                  | Deadline          |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Assignment 1     | 13 Sep @ 16:00    |
| Assignment 2     | 20 Sep @ 16:00    |
| Assignment 3     | 27 Sep @ 16:00    |
| Assignment 4     | 04 Oct @ 16:00    |
| Assignment 5     | 11 Oct @ 16:00    |
| Assignment 6     | 24 Oct @ 16:00    |

The assignments will be pass/fail; expect to have at least 66 % of an assignment correct to get a pass. It will be possible to re-handin one (and only one) assigment (1-4); deadline 18 Oct @ 16:00.

All assignment will be in groups up to 3 persons. That means that you can discuss relating material and solutions with fellow students (outside the group), TAs and lectures (it is actually encouraged), but your group have to write up your own solution to the problems. You are under no circumstances allowed to share your written solutions with fellow students outside the group.

### Feedback
Short written feedback to assignments will be given by TAs on the course. It will be given before the following exercise session, where you have the possibility to discuss with your TA. Feedback will focus on what could be approved in the assignment. The feedback may thus be useful for later assignments or the re-handin. Feedback will not give a direct justification of the evaluation (pass/fail).

## Exam qualification

To qualify for the exam you are required to pass at least 5 of the 6 assignments.
